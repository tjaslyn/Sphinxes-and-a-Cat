# Sphinxes-and-a-Cat
A Memory Game by Team Atrocious

## Inspiration
Always forgetting your loved one's birthday and feeling embarrassed? Always losing track of assignment datelines and panicking the night before? Fret not! The great Sphynx Cats are here to help you overcome life's tribulations! With their deft movement and varying pitch of meows, they want to help you improve your concentration and working memory.

## What it does
Sphynx cats are mighty and such power would only attract unwarranted attention from the likes of ordinary cats.
As the 8 Sphynx Cats (and 1 stowaway tabby cat) dart around the 3 * 3 grid mischievously, you attempt to scare the tabby away with your awesome memory recollection skills. 

Three conditions are laid down: 
    1. Same cat image used
    2. Same tile position
    3. Same sound produced. 

You would input the number of conditions that are fulfilled each round, and the grid would flash accordingly - red if it's wrong, and green if it's correct. A simple point system for each correct answer, is used for the scoring

Given the rapid pace of the game, you would need to concentrate intensely in order to excel. In the process, we assure you that your working memory skills and concentration skills would improve in some manner.

## How we built it
The Great Sphynx Cats descended upon us and proclaimed that we shall build a game in their honor. With what python code we had in our bare arsenal, we started forth on the game using Pygame. It was tough. It was FURless. And the Sphnixes were vicious in their demands. We started planning out the game based on the conditions the Sphinxes asked of us, and coded with much help from the Pygame documentation, as first-time users of Pygame.

## Challenges we ran into
We initially had many ambitious ideas relevant to android app development and micro learning. However, after much trial and error and exploration, we realised that our ideas required way more knowledge than we could learn in that limited period of time. Hence, we had to scale down our idea into something simpler and within our means, which was a game design. We still tried to retain our original idea of improving memory learning in the process. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to uphold the glory of Sphynx cats in this project! That aside, we are proud that we managed to pick up new skills of adding sounds and images to pygame. As it was the first time some of us used pygame, we are glad that we managed to create something feasible in this short period of time! 

## What's next for Sphinxes and a Cat - A Memory Game
In the future, we hope to make the game more customisable for the player. The player would be able to customise the image/ sound he wants to to suit his own needs and purposes. For instance he might want to include the shape of the countries to reinforce his memory for an upcoming geography test.

That way, our game would make learning both fun and purposeful! Meow! :)
